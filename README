Raijin JS Version 0.1

Raijin is an experimental javascript library that can be used to record and replay user actions on a page.  Similar implementations are used on user tracking sites to better understand how user's interact with elements on a page.

This project is still experimental and only tested in Firefox and Chrome. I've only set up click and mousemove events but you could add other events pretty easily.
